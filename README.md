Node REST API
===============

This is a generic and simplified API example for developing REST applications for the web using the HAPI JS framework.
 
 
Setup is based around a 'component' approach where the endpoint model, view and controller are found within the same folder.

There will be various backend data-stores added shortly :
 
 - MySQL
 - AWS DynamoDB
 - Cassandra 
 - Graph 

Install
--------

npm install 


Run
